# WK Toolkit
This project contains tools to interface with the WaniKani Japanese
language-learning service.

These tools are _not_ endorsed by WaniKani.

# Dependencies
* Python 3.5+
* Python requests
* Python keyring

# Author's Note
This Python toolkit is for now a proof-of-concept. Until a project comes along
that might make use of these tools, I won't be extending the Python version
much, if at all.

In its present state, this tool demonstrates user token caching and handling
query results from a couple different GETs.
